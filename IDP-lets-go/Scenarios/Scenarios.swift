        "Sara and Joe were members of a large team you were on last year. You think that they are both excellent data analysts, though you don’t know either of them well personally. Both Sara and Joe have decided to apply to a fellowship, and both asked you to write a recommendation letter. There is only one fellowship available. What would you be most likely and least likely to do?",
        
        // 2
        "Your client has asked for collaboration, but you suspect that she is not fully sharing her opinions and ideas. Your team needs buy-in from her on an initial set of recommendations to be able to move forward. What would you be most likely and least likely to do?",
        
        // 3
        "You are about to serve a new client and are getting advice from a peer who served them in the past. Among other things, your colleague shares that one of the women you will be working closely with is highly competent, but he didn’t like her tendency to frequently assert strong opinions. What would you be most likely and least likely to do?",
        
        // 4
        "You have just started serving a new client, and they have asked for your input to help assign client team members to your project. They have 8 qualified candidates and offered to provide you with whatever you need to formulate your input. What would you be most likely and least likely to request?",
        
        // 5
        "Your team is nearing the end of a long, intense [project] and deserves a team event to relax. You need someone to organize the activity. Eric and Liz are [junior colleagues] with similar workloads, but Liz has been with the team longer than Eric. Who would you be most likely and least likely to ask to plan the team event?",
        
        // 6
        "Your team needs to scan and annotate a large number of your client’s archived documents for a historical analysis. Carla said that she could do it, though you know she has a lot of other work to do. Ben did not volunteer to help, but you don’t think [he] is particularly busy right now. How would you be most likely and least likely to decide how to get this scanning done?",
        
        // 7
        "A friend is considering working with a former colleague who left the [organization] to join a start-up. You recall that colleague being highly knowledgeable and a strong problem-solver, but introverted and not well-liked by the team. What would you be most likely and least likely to advise?",
        
        // 8
        "Your team has put together a capability-building workshop for your client. You first want to train a select 15-20 employees who will become program ambassadors when you roll it out. You know most employees would enjoy being chosen. What process would you be most likely and least likely to use to select participants?",
        
        // 9
        "A teammate you have worked with for the past two months – though not that closely – has asked for your input into a 360-degree feedback survey for an upcoming learning program. Your sense is that your teammate is competent, but sometimes rubs people the wrong way. The feedback request form is anonymous, so you are free to share your honest opinions. What would you be most likely and least likely to do?",
        
        // 10
        "The executive director at a non-profit client you are working with is a former engineer who only recently moved into a leadership role. You are about to make your first presentation to the executive director. What would you be most likely and least likely to do?"
